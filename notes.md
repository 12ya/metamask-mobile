# TypeScript Conversion Notes for assetFileTransformer.ts

## Types that can be immediately deduced:
- [x] `filename: string` (parameter of `process` function)
- [x] Return type of `process` function: `{ code: string }`

## Types that need further investigation:
- [x] First parameter of `process` function (currently named `src`)

## TODOs:
- [x] Determine the type and purpose of the first parameter in the `process` function
- [x] Convert `require` statements to ES6 imports
- [x] Add type annotations to the `process` function
- [x] Consider creating an interface for the module exports
- [x] Ensure all variables have proper type annotations

## Progress:
- `yarn tsc` ran successfully without unexpected errors after initial TypeScript conversion.
- Investigation of `src` parameter completed: No external references or usage found in the codebase.

## Resolved Issues:
- The `src` parameter in the `process` function has no apparent usage. We've decided to use `@ts-expect-error` to handle the type uncertainty.

## Remaining Tasks:
- None. All identified tasks have been addressed.
