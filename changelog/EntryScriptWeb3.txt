# Changelog for EntryScriptWeb3.ts

## Conversion from JavaScript to TypeScript

1. File renamed from EntryScriptWeb3.js to EntryScriptWeb3.ts
2. Added type annotations:
   - Specified `entryScriptWeb3` as `null | string`
   - Imported specific functions from 'react-native-fs' instead of the whole module

## Changes in EntryScriptWeb3.ts

1. Updated import statement:
   - From: `import RNFS from 'react-native-fs';`
   - To: `import { readFile, MainBundlePath, readFileAssets } from 'react-native-fs';`

2. Modified `init` method:
   - Added optional chaining to `Device.isIos?.()` for type safety
   - Updated RNFS function calls to use imported functions directly

3. No changes were made to the `get` method

## Changes in EntryScriptWeb3.test.ts

1. Updated mock setup for Device.isIos:
   - Changed from `Device.isIos` to `Device.default.isIos`
   - Updated all occurrences in test cases

2. Added type assertions for jest mocks:
   - Used `as jest.Mock` for RNFS function mocks

## Remaining Issues

1. TypeScript compiler reported errors related to third-party and React Native type definitions
2. No specific errors were reported for EntryScriptWeb3.ts itself

## Notes

1. The original JavaScript file was restored using git restore to maintain the original version alongside the new TypeScript version
2. No changes were made to tsconfig.js or package.json
3. All tests passed after the mock setup was corrected
